# GoClean - Incentiv

The Idea of this application is to provide a platform for incentivizing waste collection. The efficiency of Government agencies are sub par in waste management in cities as well as smaller towns. GoClean Aims to provide a platform for the people by the people. A decentralised solution to the waste management problem.

Two stakeholders

- Collectors
Volunteers/Employees associated with an agency, non-profit, Government etc who serves as waste collection points for disposal / segmentation of waste.

- Social Workers
	
Those who post the location and input the waste presence data
Those who collect the Waste and give it to collector

## Dependencies

- NPM
- Truffle
- Ganache
- Metamask


## Intended Workflow

The social worker can look at the posting [Posting the presence of waste in a specific locality] along with the location. Posting can be done by anyone for a significantly smaller reward. The collectors will verify  and document the waste bought by the social worker. A specified amount will then be transferred as tokens to the social worker. To improve reporting of presence of waste , a significantly smaller token reward can be given to the user who posted, once the collector recieves that specific waste(Brought by another or same social worker).

## Outcomes

By using the rewards system can help in increasing participation of the community in waste management.
